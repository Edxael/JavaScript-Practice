<h1>The Blog</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>On this learning journey there are several languages, technologies, frameworks, tools, etc. It would be very time consuming to learn them all, and to make matters worse, there are new ones coming every month, I think that I should chose my battles and decide what technologies and languages will be the core of my expertise. One technology that I should not ignore is the Word Press - Blogging </p>
<p>In order to incorporate this to my "Skills-Tool-Box" here is the link to my Word Press blog site I should dedicate a few minutes a week to post what I learn and think. </p>
<p> Click the image below to go to my blog and see what I just learn.</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->

<p> Below is where you will find the links to my previous projects the newest is on the bottom, the ones on the top are the first things I code, so if they look very simple is because basically I teach myself to code and those are the first thing that I code. 
 </p>
<p> Humble beginnings: even the best programmer at: NASA, GOOGLE, APPLE, MICROSOFT, ect start his/her path with a simple “Hello World”. </p>

<h1>Costa Files</h1>
<p>This is a project to build a website to store forms for restaurant employees<br>
<p>I use to work for this restaurant chain and one day the Corporate HR manager ask me for a way for him to be able to control the versions and distribution of forms to all the franchise stores, then the Accounting team ask if they can use it too, so after a couple of days of not sleep this is what I propose for the corporation to manage the documents. I would create this for no cost just to get a little more experience under my belt, they told me that will review it and propose to their managers, for the moment this is prototype hosted in my server</p>

<p>This is build using WordPress, this means I did not code this entire thing, I organize it, and design it, and yes I wrote a little code on it. To make it behave and look like I want it. </p>
<p> If you have any questions about this site let me know</p>

<h1>Play Station 3</h1>

<h1>Movies</h1>
<p>This is a simple website with some of my favorites Movies, and this is MOVIES show time.....</p>
<p>Well on the technical note, this website has a frame in HTML,in this site Im utilising the power of Bootstrap, and some icons from FottAwesome, <br>
Calling for Javascrip and Jquery online libraries, on top of that there is a .css file to overwrite  the  default values of values of the Bootstrap elements <br>
all this is done in order to make the site react to the size of the browser window and devices that is been seen<br>
NOTE: The buttons do not do nothing, this exercise was just to create someting that looks nice and is responsive. </p></p>

<div class="gap-2"></div>
<h1>Water</h1>
<p>This site is in honor of H2O we need to drink more water</p>
<p>Well on the technical note: This site is created using:</p>

<div style="margin:0px auto;display:block";>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML</li>
		<li>CSS</li>
		<li>Bootstrap</li>
		<li>Uses little Javascript</li>
		<li>Uses little Jquerry</li>
		<li>Gets images from awesome fonts</li>
		<li>Utilizes Google Fonts</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<p> The reason for all this things is to be able to make it responsive to the window size and device<br>
NOTE: The buttons do not do nothing, this exercise was just to create someting that looks nice and is responsive. </p>

<h1>PONG - The Game  (JavaScript)</h1>
<p>Here is one very simple code of the game pong, written in Java script, this is my first code page with "JavaScript" and for that reason you might find some mistakes, but I still reading tutorials and learning more, This code will be updated latter when I learn more JavaScript.</p>

<p>Note: I wrote this code myself, but is "Based" on a tutorial that I found on internet, but also "Heavily Modify" by me, to my preferences.</p>
	
<p>This game is functional, and until next update on the code, enjoy it. </p>

<h1>Space Piano Kit  (JavaScript)</h1>
<p>This website is a small Javascript that uses the keys on the Keyboard to play the sounds of a piano</p>
<p>I create this following a tutorial, I got good learning but there are a couple of items that I need to review again to be able to grasp the idea of how it works <br>
I did change the code to make this site unique, and created in the way that I think would be better for the user<br>
The site works and you are more than welcome to check the CODE</p>

<p>Note: I wrote this code myself, but is "Based" on a tutorial that I found on internet, but also "Heavily Modify" by me, to my preferences.</p>>
